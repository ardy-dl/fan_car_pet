1. Choose the test_fan and fan_class file to run the fan program.  
2. Create objects with arguments or attributes(Name of the fan, speed(1,2, or 3), radius(float), color) in the test_fan file.
3. You can call the on and off method to turn on and off the fan.
4. Run the program and the attributes of the fan will be displayed in the terminal.

# CAR

- The program displays the year model, make and speed of the object(car).
- Used to modify the speed of the car(object).
  
## How to use?
1. Choose the test_car and car_class file to run the car program.
2. The program has 4 methods you can call:
    - show() - used to display all attributes of the created object
    - accelerate() - used to increase the speed of the object
    - brake() - used to reduce the speed of the object
    - get_speed() - used to display the current speed of the object
3. Create the objects with arguments in the ff. arrangement(year model, make, and speed) in the test_car file.
4. Run the program 

# PET

    - set(name, animal_type, age) - used to store the data input by the user.
  
## How to use?
1. Choose the test_pet and pet_class file to run the car program.
